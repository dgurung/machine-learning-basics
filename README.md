# Statistical Machine Learning Basics

This repository contains implementation of classifiers including Fisher dicriminant, logistic regression, perpectrons. This repository also contains linear methods for regression including least squares estimates, subset selection method and ridge regression. The dataset for training and testing can be found in [1].

Each of the methods in this repository are written without importing other libraries. Exceptionals are `numpy` for array  manipulation and `confusion_matrix` and `accuracy_score` from `sklearn.metrics`.
