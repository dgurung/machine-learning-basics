# Statistical Machine Learning Basics

This repository contains implementation of classifiers and linear regression methods. 

##### Classifiers:
1. Fisher Discriminant
2. Perceptrons
3. Neural Network (single hidden layer)

##### Regressions:
1. Linear regression based on oridnary least squares (OLS)
2. Subset selection method for linear regression 
3. Logistic Regression
4. Ridge Regression

Libraries imported: numpy for data structure, sklearn for computing error merics, and matplotlib for data visualization. The dataset for training and testing can be found in [1].
